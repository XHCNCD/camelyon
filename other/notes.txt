If starting again:
Make sure to check making the strict dataset, as well as the test tile dataset.
Check what went wrong with the Chowder model. No idea what went wrong

Check the google/normal WSI models:
Seems the tile classifier was ok. Probably somewhere with heatmap generation. 
To check if heatmap is semnsible logistic regression on max heatmap value or something like this should give acc > .5
